Dear HR Manager:

This letter is to express my interest in your posting on Stackoverflow.com for Senior Full Stack Developer. With a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and hands-on experience using Java, JavaScript languages to create and implement software applications, I am confident I will be an asset to your organization.
I enjoy being challenged and engaging with projects that require me to work outside my comfort and knowledge set, as continuing to learn new languages and development techniques are important to me and the success of your organization.
A few I would like to highlight that would enable me to contribute to your bottom line are:
	* Having skilled in designing and developing software.
	* Good knowledge and understanding of data structures and algorithms
	* Hands-on software troubleshooting experience

I’ve attached a copy of my resume that details my projects and experience in software development. I can be reached anytime via my cell phone, +919486975979 or via email at manoelangoo@gmail.com.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to speaking with you about this opportunity.

Sincerely,
Manikandan Elangovan
