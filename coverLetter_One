Dear HR Manager,

This letter is to express my interest in your posting on freshworks.com for Front End Developer. With a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science and hands-on experience using Java, JavaScript languages to create and implement software applications, I am confident I will be an asset to your organization.
I enjoy being challenged and engaging with projects that require me to work outside my comfort and knowledge set, as continuing to learn new languages and development techniques are important to me and the success of your organization.

I know that freshworks has doubled the size of the business in the past 2 years. I love the way it expands its products without compromising the quality, that's why I like the company and would like to be a part of the amazing team.

A few I would like to highlight that would enable me to contribute to your bottom line are:

   * Having skilled in designing and developing software
   * Good knowledge and understanding of data structures and algorithms
   * Hands-on software troubleshooting experience

I can be reached anytime via my cell phone or via email.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to speaking with you about this opportunity.

Sincerely,
Manikandan Elangovan
